## Introduction

X-Road® Metrics is a tool for collecting, storing and analysing reporting data and metrics from an
[X-Road®](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road) ecosystem. The data can be used to measure usage of individual
services, understand dependencies and relationships between different information systems and services, monitor service
health, etc. Also, the information can be published as open data.

X-Road Metrics can be used by both X-Road Operators and X-Road Members. The X-Road Operator can use X-Road Metrics to
collect data from an entire X-Road ecosystem while X-Road Members can access their own data.

## Architecture

The system architecture is described in the [System Architecture](./docs/system_architecture.md) document.

## Installation instructions

### Installing/setting up the Mongo Database (MongoDB)

The **first thing** that should be done is setting up the MongoDB.
Instructions on setting up the MongoDB can be found in the [Database Module](./docs/database_module.md) document.

### Module installation precedence

The modules should be set up in the following order:

 - [Database module](./docs/database_module.md)
 - [Collector module](./docs/collector_module.md)
 - [Corrector module](./docs/corrector_module.md)
 - [Reports module](./docs/reports_module.md)
 - [Anonymizer module](./docs/anonymizer_module.md)
 - [Opendata module](./docs/opendata_module.md)
 - [Networking/Visualizer module](./docs/networking_module.md)
 - [Opendata Collector module](./docs/opendata_collector_module.md)

## Programming language

All modules, except Networking, are written in [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)&trade; and tested with version 3.8
Other 3.x versions are likely to be compatible, give or take some 3rd party library interfaces.
Networking module is written in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/).
