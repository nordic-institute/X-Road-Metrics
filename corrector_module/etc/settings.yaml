# Default settings file for X-Road Metrics Corrector-module.
# Fill in your MongoDB and X-Road configuration.
#
# To run corrector for many different X-Road instances, you can create settings
# profiles. For example to have profiles DEV, TEST and PROD copy this file to
# settings_DEV.yaml, settings_TEST.yaml and settings_PROD.yaml.
# Then fill the profile specific settings to each file and use the --profile
# flag when starting xroad-metrics-corrector. For example to run using the TEST profile:
#    xroad-metrics-correctord --profile TEST
