# Default settings file for X-Road Metrics Collector-module.
# Fill in your MongoDB and X-Road configuration.
#
# To run collector for many different X-Road instances, you can create settings
# profiles. For example to have profiles DEV, TEST and PROD copy this file to
# settings_DEV.yaml, settings_TEST.yaml and settings_PROD.yaml.
# Then fill the profile specific settings to each file and use the --profile
# flag when running xroad-metrics-collector. For example to run using the TEST profile:
#    xroad-metrics-collector --profile TEST collect

collector:
  # Match thread-count with number of cores * CPUs available to ensure best performance
  thread-count: 10

  # Collector collects entries that are:
  #    timestamped AFTER (NOW - records-from-offset)
  #      AND
  #    timestamped BEFORE (NOW - records-to-offset)
  #
  # records-from-offset must be bigger than records-to-offset.
  # Offset times are in seconds, for example:
  #   1h = 3600
  #   1d = 86400
  #   1 week = 604800
  #   1 month = 2678400
  #   1 year = 31536000

  # Repeat query to fetch additional data only if server has returned at least as much records.
  # By default servers should return 10000 records, so this value should be smaller.

  # How many times to repeat query if server has more records ("nextRecordsFrom" is returned by previous query).
  # Set to 0 to disable query repeating.
  # If this value is too low and script is executed rarely then some data may be lost.
