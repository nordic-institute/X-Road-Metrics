# To run anonymizer for many different X-Road instances, you can create settings
# profiles. For example to have profiles DEV, TEST and PROD copy this file to
# settings_DEV.yaml, settings_TEST.yaml and settings_PROD.yaml.
# Then fill the profile specific settings to each file and use the --profile
# flag when running xroad-metrics-anonymizer. For example to run using the TEST profile:
#    xroad-metrics-anonymizer --profile TEST
